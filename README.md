## Acorns Case Study-HTK

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Acorns

* When was the company incorporated and who are the founders of the company? 
Acorns, headquartered in Irvine, California, was founded in 2012 by father and son duo Walter and Jeff Cruttenden(Carlozo,15 Nov.2020).

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Walter, the father, led E-Trade’s transition into becoming an online investment platform in the late 1990s with the launch E-Offering. He frequently spoke about investing at the family’s dinner table – and parts of that seemed to have rubbed off on Jeff. In late 2011, Jeff began talking to his father about taking advantage of the rising popularity of smartphones. The idea was to make investing more appealing to the public, especially since its distrust in financial institutions post the Great Depression was at an all-time high(Viktor,2020).

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
Acorns are micro investing company. The price of subscription for the program is 1,3, and 5 dollars which could say rational price. In fact, Acorns are micro company where uses the round up system. We can suspect that the money we save for month could be in high ratio of subscription price. When we are changing our ETF (Exchange Trade Fund) to out of Acorns ETF, we need to pay 50 dollars. Acorns received 8.6 hundred million via subscription and accounts transfer fees(Benson,2 Dec.2020). 

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
The main problem of automatic micro investment of ETF is customers are limited options. Customers have only 5 options for the investment. 
The Five Category of ETF: 
1. Conservative: 20% stocks / 80% bonds.
2. Moderately Conservative: 40% stocks / 60% bonds.
3. Moderate: 60% stocks / 40% bonds.
4. Moderately Aggressive: 72% stocks / 28% bonds.
5. Aggressive: 80% stocks / 20% bonds.
If customers save more than 5,000 dollars. Acorns perceives them as not micro investors. Customers must pay the 0.25 percent fees for portfolio. 
When the customers have loss of asset, even they had agreement of funds of risk, they are blaming the company due to the limited options(Reiff,27 Nov.2020).  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The main target of customers are micro investors and people who are not good at saving. There is no information about market size set of customers but round up system or fees for above 5,000 dollars implicitly leads customers to do the micro investment(Maddox,15 Nov.2020). 
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Most of mobile investing apps have good and reliable portfolios as Acorns but they are taking the 0.25 percent fees for the investment which Acorns does not take, if customer saves less than 5,000 dollars. This is the unfair advantage of the price that customer does not notice. Most customers care about the numbers that is on the screen. 1,3, and 5 dollars for month sounds better for 0.25 percentage(Maddox,15 Nov.2020). 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stack share to find this information.)

## Recommendations

The main problem of Acorns is customers are acquainted with micro investing. In flip side, they are not best in macro investment. 
We need to have other options for macro investing customers. 
We do not need to change Acorns the five options, we can add more categories divided it as field of company and amount of money.

Acorns is micro investing company. They already predominate the micro filed. Thus, it is profitable for them to move to macro investing ways.  
Customer can choose the field that they love to such as sports, music, or even investing company. Acorns needs to make new categories, but it will give comparative advantages for customers who want to invest in specific areas. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Acorns is already using almost all financial technologies. They need to work additionally. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Based on the technologies, we are going to the next level of investing way. It is always good to have easy way but some time easy with specific items can also attract the customers. 
They already had enough technologies but need more big data of companies.
